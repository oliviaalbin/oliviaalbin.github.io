                <p>This project was created as a group assignment for a UX course focusing on critical making 
                    and DIY projects.</p>
                <p>In order to address aspects of urban poverty and food insecurity, our team (Julia Purza, 
                    Chantal Vaillancourt, Mary McDonald, and myself) developed a micro garden starter kit to 
                    provide the materials and resources needed for individuals to grow vegetables in their home. 
                    This design includes multiple components that combine to create the starter kit: vegetable seeds, 
                    potting soil, a window-mounted shelf, and a starter guide.</p>

                <p>In developing this project, our team conducted research and came to understand that people who 
                    experience poverty often lack a sufficient and sustaining food supply, leading to malnutrition 
                    (Shisanya and Handriks 509). We also discovered that micro and community gardening can have a positive 
                    impact on the alleviation of these social issues. This result is supported if sufficient training 
                    and support is in place to ensure success of the garden (Shisanya and Hendriks 509; Food and 
                    Agriculture Organization). This is why we decided to focus much of our time to creating a
                    starter guide that would help the user with setup and caring for their plants. We also wanted to stay
                    true to the DIY nature of many affordable micro gardens and so promote the use of recycled containers for
                    potting and the utilization of natural sunlight rather than expensive LED grow lights.</p>
